# Landing Page Project

In this project I practiced the knowledge just learned during JavaScript and the DOM lessons at Udacity course Front End Web Developer.

I built an interactive navigation bar using an unordered list structure as requested in the exercise, and added a button for each section to scroll smoothly to the corresponding text in the page.

I styled each button customising the background color to relate to the samme shade in the page section, to make it more user friendly and intuitive.

Finally, I created an active class that is only active on the current section on the viewport, to highlight the displayed element with the animated circles and a slightly darker background.
